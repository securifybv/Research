# Pwning WordPress with Cross-Site Scripting
Metasploit exploit module for exploiting XSS vulnerabilities in WordPress. If the exploit module is successful, a Meterpreter Session will be started on the target WordPress site. Before the attack is initiated the module first tries to determine whether the 404 to 301 Plugin is installed and activated.
